## NEVER RUN THESE FILES ON YOUR ROOT DIRECTORY (I tried it and... Well, it didn't turn out very well)

# HOW TO USE
This is a cryptograpy module based ransomware purely made to prank your friends. To start, clone the repo and just send the exe to your friend that has Python installed on their computers. The code is in my mother language, Turkish right now, and the password is 'abuziddin' but I'll make it English compatible ASAP.
